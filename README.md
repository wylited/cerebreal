Disclamer: Cerebreal is still under heavy development and is far from any realistic use.

# What?

Cerebreal is a local first, knowledge managment system that utilizes the power of Org-Mode without the requirement to learn GNU Emacs.

It is built using Tauri and currently able to be packaged for the web as well as most desktop platforms. (Windows, MacOS, Linux (.rpm, .deb, AppImage alike)).

# Why?
Currently, there is a lack of note taking tool utilizes the power of org-mode created by gnu emacs.

> I wanted to create a tool that would allow me to take notes in a way that I could easily search and organize while utilizing embedded latex equations and graphs.

## Setting Up

1. Install [Tauri Prerequisites](https://tauri.studio/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)
2. Clone and install dependencies (this template uses `pnpm` by default):

```sh
pnpm i
```


## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

## Usage

A Tauri app has at least [two processes](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/architecture/process-model):

- the Core Process (`backend`, or _main_ process in Electron terminology), and
- the WebView process (`frontend`, or _renderer_ in Electron)

### ðŸ¦¢ Frontend (TS, PnPM)

#### Running Development Server

Both back- and frontend start with a single command:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

#### Testing

```sh
pnpm test
```

### ðŸ¦€ Backend (Rust, Cargo)

Backend code lives in `src-tauri/` (Following commands are to be run from there.)

#### Finding Outdated Rust Dependencies

If you have [cargo-outdated](https://github.com/kbknapp/cargo-outdated) installed:

```sh
cargo outdated
```

#### Upgrading Rust Dependencies

If you have [cargo-edit](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit) installed:

```sh
cargo upgrade
```

### Debugging

- The `dev` command has by default `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` set which makes Rust output full backtraces to the console. (Simply remove it from the package.json command if you want it).
- If you use VS Code, you can debug Rust code with the included `Debug Tauri` config.

### Building and releasing

#### Building

The project has GitHub Actions set up which will automatically test and build your app with every push and PR. For building manually:

```sh
pnpm build
```

#### Releasing a new version

1. Bump version number (In `package.json`, and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`)
2. Run `pnpm check` to update `Cargo.lock`
3. Tag the commit you want to release with `vX.Y.Z`
4. Edit the release notes and push (also tags!)
5. Github workflow will automatically build a new draft release for this version. Publish when ready ðŸŽ‰
